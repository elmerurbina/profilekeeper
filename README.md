# ProfileKeeper

ProfileKeeper is a web application built using React.js that allows users to manage their profiles on different websites. It enables users to store the name, icon, URL, and description of the platforms they are active on, all in one place. The app uses local storage to save the userâ€™s data and ensures that each user can see only their own profiles.

## How It Works

1. **Add New Profiles**:  
   Users can add a new profile by entering the name of the platform, an icon URL, the profile URL, and a brief description of the platform. These details are then saved in the local storage.

2. **View Profiles**:  
   The profiles that the user has added will be displayed with their respective icons and descriptions. Each profile is linked to its respective platform's URL, allowing users to visit them directly.

3. **Persistence**:  
   All the data entered is stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that even if the page is refreshed or reopened, the profiles will still be available.
